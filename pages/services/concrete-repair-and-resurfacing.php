                        <p class="servicesTexts">
                            Give your old floors a fresh, like-new appearance with our professional floor repair and resurfacing services.
                            This cost-effective solution delivers high-quality results without the need for full replacement.
                            Floor repair targets and fixes specific damaged areas, while resurfacing involves applying a new layer—typically a cement-based overlay or a polymer-modified coating—that restores and enhances the surface.
                            These techniques are suitable for a wide range of flooring types, making them a versatile option for both residential and commercial spaces.

                        <h5 class="font-weight-bold mt-3">Chemical Reactions That Damage Concrete</h5>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Alkali-Silica Reaction (ASR)</li>
                            <li>Sulfate</li>
                            <li>Acid</li>
                        </ul>
                        <h5 class="font-weight-bold">Freeze-Thaw Disintegration</h5>
                        <p class="servicesTexts">
                            Freeze-thaw disintegration occurs when water trapped inside concrete freezes and expands in cold weather. 
                            As temperatures fluctuate, the repeated freezing and thawing of water causes internal pressure within the concrete, leading to surface cracking and flaking.
                        </p>
                        <h5 class="font-weight-bold">Corrosion</h5>
                        <p>
                            Corrosion is one of the most common causes of concrete damage, particularly in regions with four seasons. 
                            The use of de-icing salts during winter months, combined with moisture exposure, weakens the concrete’s natural alkalinity. 
                            This allows chloride ions to penetrate the concrete and reach the steel reinforcement inside.
