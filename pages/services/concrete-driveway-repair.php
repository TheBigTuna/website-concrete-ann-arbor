                        <h5 class="font-weight-bold mt-5">Cracks in the Surface</h5>
                        <p class="servicesTexts">
                            Small cracks may not seem serious, but over time they can grow and allow water to seep in, causing more extensive damage.
                        </p>
                        <h5 class="font-weight-bold">Potholes or Uneven Areas</h5>
                        <p class="servicesTexts">
                            Depressions or holes can form due to shifting soil or repeated pressure from vehicles. 
                            These pose safety risks and can worsen quickly.

                            Pools of water after rain can indicate poor drainage or an uneven surface—both of which can accelerate concrete deterioration.
                        </p>

                            Oil spills, chemicals, and sun exposure can cause discoloration and reduce the visual appeal of your driveway.

                        <h5 class="font-weight-bold">Flaking or Chipping</h5>
                        <p class="servicesTexts">
                            If the surface of your concrete is crumbling or peeling away, it may be due to harsh weather or aging materials.

                            Sections of concrete that rise above others may be caused by tree roots or freeze-thaw cycles, and should be addressed immediately.
